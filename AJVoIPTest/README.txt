Example project for AJVoIP -the Mizutech SIP library for Android

This is a very simple test project (Android application) using the AJVoIP SIP client library capable to register and make call.
The relevant code (the most important file worth to inspect) can be found in this file:
	\AJVoIPTest\app\src\main\java\com\ajvoiptest\MainActivity.java  
	(actually this is the single java source code file in the project)

Usage:
	Open the project in Android Studio.
	Copy the AJVoIP.aar into the \AJVoIPTest\AJVoIP folder!
	You might also need to adjust the SDK version and location in the following files:
		local.properties 
		\app\ build.gradle
	From Android Studio select Rebuild Project from the Build menu. Once the rebuild is ready, you can Run it (on your device or in emulator)
